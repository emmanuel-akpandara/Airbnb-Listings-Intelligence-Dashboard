# Airbnb Listings & Review Intelligence Dashboard

A Business Intelligence project built with Power BI and Python to analyze Airbnb listings across major Belgian cities. It uncovers trends in review sentiment, pricing, host behavior, and prescriptive recommendations for property improvement.

##  Dataset

### Tables used:

fact_Listing: Contains listing ID, price, rating, host_id, minimum nights

dim_Review: User comments and ratings

dim_Host: Host metadata (host_id, host_name)

dim_City: City-level location

dim_Neighbourhood: Neighbourhood metadata linked to city

Sample data files available in /data

##  Data Preparation (Power Query)

### Key steps:
<ul></ul>
Merged listing and review data to enrich each record

Removed nulls in comments, ratings, and price

Created new columns:

Sentiment (via Python + TextBlob)

Combo = property_type + room_type

Established relationships via a clean star schema (fact-listing at center)

Power Query transformations available in the .pbix file and described in /docs/schema.md

## Sentiment Analysis (Python)

Used Python in Power Query to label sentiment per comment:

from textblob import TextBlob
def get_sentiment(text):
    polarity = TextBlob(text).sentiment.polarity
    if polarity > 0.1:
        return 'Positive'
    elif polarity < -0.1:
        return 'Negative'
    else:
        return 'Neutral'

Output used to:
<ul></ul>
Visualize sentiment distribution per city

Highlight negative reviews for diagnostic analysis

Drive topic modeling and improvement suggestions
