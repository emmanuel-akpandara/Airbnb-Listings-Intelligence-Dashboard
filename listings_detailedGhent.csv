I'm Barbara, a 40 year old local Ghentian crazy about chocolate and pilates! Friends describe me as 'Audrey Hepburn meets bubblegum'! I kinda think this explains it all! ;) 

I host a beautiful house called Sint-Ivo in the historical city center of Ghent. 

The house dates from the 14th century. It was originally called 'The Cogghe' - a referral to the ships that cruised the river. In 1748 the lawyers association together with doorkeepers and prosecutors settled into the house and named it Saint Ivo - lawyer of the poor in the 13th century.

I‚Äôm spending a great deal of my time on my passion for coffee and hospitality. Doing sports, traveling, reading and riding my motorbike are some other things I love. 
At this point I have expanded the business to the point that we follow up on the entire chain from coffee tree to cup. I‚Äôm spending a lot of time in Colombia, where I visit local farmers in order to get the best coffee for the coffee bar. 
I used to travel quite adventurously myself. I still cherish these memorable moments of spontaneous hospitality and I take this as starting point to treat my guests.

Na een academische carri√®re en jaren in het onderwijs, ben ik sinds 2011 de trotse eigenaar van het koffiehuis ‚ÄúCaf√© Labath‚Äù te Gent. 
Mijn passie voor koffie en hospitality vraagt het grootste deel van mijn tijd, daarnaast ga ik graag sporten, lezen en motorijden. Ik heb enkele avontuurlijke reizen gedaan, en de reismicrobe heeft me nog steeds niet losgelaten. Intussen spendeer ik veel tijd in Colombia, om daar ‚ÄúDirect Trade‚Äù koffie te zoeken. Door goede banden op te bouwen met lokale boeren, kan ik de lekkerste koffies importeren voor de koffiebar.
De memorabele momenten van spontane gastvrijheid op mijn reizen koester ik nog steeds. Die gastvrijheid heb ik steeds zelf voor ogen bij het ontvangen van mijn gasten.

Born and raised in Moorslede and Bruges, we studied in Ghent and in Brussels. We fell in love and decided to settle in the beautiful city of Ghent. Whilst looking for a place to live, we bumped into what could be considered as one of the most centralised houses of Ghent. The house was old, dark and didn‚Äôt catch a lot of sunlight, but we saw a lot of possibilities to transform it into a little paradise in the ancient centre, close to all the hip and trendy places this city has to offer. As we travel a lot ourselves, we think we know what it takes to have a pleasant stay and discovering new cities and countries. We transformed the house in an ideal place for friends and guests visiting Ghent. By the summer of 2020 the house was finished.   
We hope you enjoy it as much as we do. 
Welcome in Ghent!

Happy to have you stay with us in our house, we hope it makes you, as many others, feel at home.

When looking for dates to book, might be a good idea to look up agelandkaai online, (our landcode is be), and have a look there, you'll find special offers on restaurants, the parking policy and other extra's, like our walking tours through Gent, and what we offer on food and drinks.

You might notice that we are not available on saturdays for checking in or out. That way we keep our saturdays somewhat to ourselves (cleaning wise). Or to have time for our experience, a historic walking tour through Gent, with Jurgen as your guide.

However if you're staying for four or more days, you can always inquire to arrive or leave on a saturday. Mostly won't be a problem.

At this point I have expanded the business to the point that we follow up on the entire chain from coffee tree to cup. I‚Äôm spending a lot of time in Colombia, where I visit local farmers in order to get the best coffee for the coffee bar. 
I used to travel quite adventurously myself. I still cherish these memorable moments of spontaneous hospitality and I take this as starting point to treat my guests.

Na een academische carri√®re en jaren in het onderwijs, ben ik sinds 2011 de trotse eigenaar van het koffiehuis ‚ÄúCaf√© Labath‚Äù te Gent. 
Mijn passie voor koffie en hospitality vraagt het grootste deel van mijn tijd, daarnaast ga ik graag sporten, lezen en motorijden. Ik heb enkele avontuurlijke reizen gedaan, en de reismicrobe heeft me nog steeds niet losgelaten. Intussen spendeer ik veel tijd in Colombia, om daar ‚ÄúDirect Trade‚Äù koffie te zoeken. Door goede banden op te bouwen met lokale boeren, kan ik de lekkerste koffies importeren voor de koffiebar.
De memorabele momenten van spontane gastvrijheid op mijn reizen koester ik nog steeds. Die gastvrijheid heb ik steeds zelf voor ogen bij het ontvangen van mijn gasten.

I‚Äôm spending a great deal of my time on my passion for coffee and hospitality. Doing sports, traveling, reading and riding my motorbike are some other things I love. 
At this point I have expanded the business to the point that we follow up on the entire chain from coffee tree to cup. I‚Äôm spending a lot of time in Colombia, where I visit local farmers in order to get the best coffee for the coffee bar. 
I used to travel quite adventurously myself. I still cherish these memorable moments of spontaneous hospitality and I take this as starting point to treat my guests.

Na een academische carri√®re en jaren in het onderwijs, ben ik sinds 2011 de trotse eigenaar van het koffiehuis ‚ÄúCaf√© Labath‚Äù te Gent. 
Mijn passie voor koffie en hospitality vraagt het grootste deel van mijn tijd, daarnaast ga ik graag sporten, lezen en motorijden. Ik heb enkele avontuurlijke reizen gedaan, en de reismicrobe heeft me nog steeds niet losgelaten. Intussen spendeer ik veel tijd in Colombia, om daar ‚ÄúDirect Trade‚Äù koffie te zoeken. Door goede banden op te bouwen met lokale boeren, kan ik de lekkerste koffies importeren voor de koffiebar.
De memorabele momenten van spontane gastvrijheid op mijn reizen koester ik nog steeds. Die gastvrijheid heb ik steeds zelf voor ogen bij het ontvangen van mijn gasten.

I‚Äôm spending a great deal of my time on my passion for coffee and hospitality. Doing sports, traveling, reading and riding my motorbike are some other things I love. 
At this point I have expanded the business to the point that we follow up on the entire chain from coffee tree to cup. I‚Äôm spending a lot of time in Colombia, where I visit local farmers in order to get the best coffee for the coffee bar. 
I used to travel quite adventurously myself. I still cherish these memorable moments of spontaneous hospitality and I take this as starting point to treat my guests.

Na een academische carri√®re en jaren in het onderwijs, ben ik sinds 2011 de trotse eigenaar van het koffiehuis ‚ÄúCaf√© Labath‚Äù te Gent. 
Mijn passie voor koffie en hospitality vraagt het grootste deel van mijn tijd, daarnaast ga ik graag sporten, lezen en motorijden. Ik heb enkele avontuurlijke reizen gedaan, en de reismicrobe heeft me nog steeds niet losgelaten. Intussen spendeer ik veel tijd in Colombia, om daar ‚ÄúDirect Trade‚Äù koffie te zoeken. Door goede banden op te bouwen met lokale boeren, kan ik de lekkerste koffies importeren voor de koffiebar.
De memorabele momenten van spontane gastvrijheid op mijn reizen koester ik nog steeds. Die gastvrijheid heb ik steeds zelf voor ogen bij het ontvangen van mijn gasten.

Born and raised in Moorslede and Bruges, we studied in Ghent and in Brussels. We fell in love and decided to settle in the beautiful city of Ghent. Whilst looking for a place to live, we bumped into what could be considered as one of the most centralised houses of Ghent. The house was old, dark and didn‚Äôt catch a lot of sunlight, but we saw a lot of possibilities to transform it into a little paradise in the ancient centre, close to all the hip and trendy places this city has to offer. As we travel a lot ourselves, we think we know what it takes to have a pleasant stay and discovering new cities and countries. We transformed the house in an ideal place for friends and guests visiting Ghent. By the summer of 2020 the house was finished.

Born and raised in Moorslede and Bruges, we studied in Ghent and in Brussels. We fell in love and decided to settle in the beautiful city of Ghent. Whilst looking for a place to live, we bumped into what could be considered as one of the most centralised houses of Ghent. The house was old, dark and didn‚Äôt catch a lot of sunlight, but we saw a lot of possibilities to transform it into a little paradise in the ancient centre, close to all the hip and trendy places this city has to offer. As we travel a lot ourselves, we think we know what it takes to have a pleasant stay and discovering new cities and countries. We transformed the house in an ideal place for friends and guests visiting Ghent. By the summer of 2020 the house was finished.   
We hope you enjoy it as much as we do. 
Welcome in Ghent!

To be more specific, I make ambient meditation music and give sound healings to help people in the process of Spiritual Awakening. So I love having deep conversations with wonderful souls.

I am Vincent, since many years living in the very centre of Ghent. I enjoy delicious drinks and finger licking food, a night in or out with friends, an occasional run, hiking trips and tunes from around the globe.
Like many others, i also love to travel, basically anywhere. Up to now i have mostly enjoyed the hospitality of others during our travels. But, a while ago an opportunity presented itself for me to open up my own holiday place and i just grabbed it. I am super excited to present my unique holiday home and to welcome all kinds of people regardless of colour, gender, sexual orientation or religion, to come and stay over while exploring the lovely city of Ghent.
I have lived and worked in Ghent for many, many years, know where to find hidden gems and so have quite some tips & tricks for visitors.

I am Vincent, since many years living in the very centre of Ghent. I enjoy delicious drinks and finger licking food, a night in or out with friends, an occasional run, hiking trips and tunes from around the globe.
Like many others, i also love to travel, basically anywhere. Up to now i have mostly enjoyed the hospitality of others during our travels. But, a while ago an opportunity presented itself for me to open up my own holiday place and i just grabbed it. I am super excited to present my unique holiday home and to welcome all kinds of people regardless of colour, gender, sexual orientation or religion, to come and stay over while exploring the lovely city of Ghent.
I have lived and worked in Ghent for many, many years, know where to find hidden gems and so have quite some tips & tricks for visitors.
I hope to welcome you soon and help make your visit to Ghent unforgettable!
